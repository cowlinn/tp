### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of UI Component](./images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `PolicyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

Similarly, the layout of [`PersonListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/PersonListPanel.java), [`PolicyListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/PolicyListPanel.java) and [`EventListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/EventListPanel.java) are all specified in their respective [`.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) files.

The layout of [`IncomeGraph`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/IncomeGraph.java) is specified in [`LineGraph.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/LineGraph.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model`, `Policy` and `Event` component, as it displays `Person`, `Policy` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the following address book data
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
  * all `Policy` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePolicyList` object)
  <img src="images/ModelPolicyClassDiagram.png" width="500" />
  * all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object)
  <img src="images/ModelEventClassDiagram.png"  width="500"/>
* stores the currently 'selected' `XYZ` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `XYZ` refers to either Person, Policy or Event</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `longtimenosee.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### pin and viewPin feature

#### Implementation

Each person object has a boolean attribute known as pinned. When the user pins the person using the index. This attribute will be set to true. When the user pins that same person again, this attribute will be set to false.


* `pin <Index>`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the boolean pinned attribute to a value of true.
* `pin <Index>`â€‰â€”â€‰If the boolean pinned attribute was previously set true, calling the command again will set it to false.
* `viewPin`â€‰â€”â€‰Uses the predicate PinnedPersonPredicate to sort the full list of existing clients to display only clients with pinned attribute of true.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how pin works:

![PinSequenceDiagram](images/PinSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

#### Pin activity diagram:
<img src="images/PinActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### View Pin Activity diagram:
<img src="images/ViewPinActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How pin and viewPin executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a predicate to sort through pinned clients.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard for additional extensions given that this method uses a boolean attribute.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire address book of clients pinned.
  * Pros: More potential for further extensions.
  * Cons: May result in performance issues in terms of memory usage.

### viewIncome feature

#### Implementation

This feature builds on the new policy class created. Where each client has a set of policies assigned to them. In this case, a financial advisorâ€™s income is treated as a class by itself. Where inside the class there are methods of retrieving the income based on different factors stated below.

The main calculation done in class FinancialAdvisorIncome is a function called calculateIncome. This function iterates through a list of clients and for each client, it iterates through the list of policies they have. For each of the policies, LocalDate and Period are used to determine which commission (out of the 3 year differing rates) the assigned policy of the current person is in. Subsequently, all commissions are multiplied by policy premium with the duration of the policy (relative from start date to given date) and summed to give income for a particular year.

* `viewIncome <Year>`â€‰â€”â€‰Invokes the calculation of user's three year income with `<Year>` as the first year via the function .

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin mechanism behaves at each step. (To be continued)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How viewIncome executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encapsulate user's income into a class of its own
    * Pros: By assigning FinancialAdvisorIncome as a class, we are able to add an additional layer of abstraction to deriving the financial advisors income. By doing so, it is easier to utilise the income for other features.
    * Cons: Might pose a problem for retrival of values from class.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire address book of clients pinned.
    * Pros: More potential for further extensions.
    * Cons: May result in performance issues in terms of memory usage.


### Sort Feature

#### Implementation

The Sort mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`, which utilizes Java's `ObservableList` library to store the client list.

The method `FXCollections.sort()` is called by UniquePersonList, which takes in a comparator as an argument and sorts the client list based on the comparator supplied.
Each attribute of a client which is considered a valid sorting metric has its own comparator within its class.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sort()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Sort` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1.  The user executes `list` to view his current client list.

Step 2. The user executes `sort income` to view his client list by ascending income levels. This will pass the income comparator to `Model#sort()`. The list will be sorted and changes can be viewed immediately.


The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![Sort Sequence Diagram](./images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user issues a `sort` command:

![Sort Activity Diagram](./images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to manage saving changes to `Storage`**

As any commands called which modifies the `AddressBook` will save these changes to storage, a major design consideration was whether to save these post-sort changes to the storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** save the changes as per normal but provide an option to return to the default sorting view
  * Pros: Easy to implement, less memory required to keep separate original list 
  * Cons: Client list remains in a particular order after `sort` command is called until `sort default` is issued

* **Alternative 2:** keep original list and sorted list as 2 separate lists 
  * Pros: User need not call further command to view original list
  * Cons: More memory to store 2nd list, more difficult to implement 

**Aspect: How to sort list given different metrics** 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** each sortable class has its own comparator and will be passed as an argument after `sort` command is parsed
  * Pros: Better abstraction and Better OOP 
  * Cons: Comparators must be written for every class  

* **Alternative 2:** `Model` decides how to sort the client list based on sort metric called 
  * Pros: Easier to implement 
  * Cons: less abstraction; information about client attributes will have to be unnecessarily exposed to `Model` class 


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state/

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />



## AddEvent Feature 

### Proposed Implementation 
The proposed `AddEvent` feature is facilitated by the `AddressBook` Model. The `AddressBook` contains information on the list of people and the current events available (i.e: `UniqueEventList` and `UniquePersonList`). The `AddEventParser`  serves as an additional <i>abstraction of logic</i> to determine the validity of an Event on the following conditions, and throws an appropriate exception based on the following conditions. 

* Valid Client Name : An event is tagged to a single Client. The Clientâ€™s name must already exist in the `UniqueEventList`. If said person specified does not exist, the `AddEventParser` throws an: `InvalidPersonException`

* No overlapping events: . If the event overlaps with another event (i.e: occurs on the same day, and has a start and end time that coincides with another event in `UniqueEventList`, the `AddEventParser` throws an: `OverlapEventException`.)

### Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddEventCommand` behaves at each step.

<B>Step 1</B>. The user launches the application for the first time. The` AddressBook` model is initialized with both the appropriate `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueEventList`. The lists are empty, with a person named `John Williams`. 


<B>Step 2</B>. The user adds an event `newEvent desc Star Wars Soundtrack  pName John Williams, date/2020-01-01, start/12:00 end/13:00`. The event is added successfully.


<B>Step 3</B>. The user then adds a new event `newEvent desc JurassicWorld Soundtrack  pName John Williams, date/2020-01-01, start/12:30 end/13:00`. This time window of this event overlaps with the previously event, and the Event List is no longer updated. An `OverlapEventException` is thrown by the parser.


### The following activity diagram summarizes how an `AddEventCommand` is parsed at each step.

<p align ="center"> <img src="images/AddEventActivityDiagram.png" width="650" /> </p>



## Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


**Aspect: Should events that occured in the past be auto-deleted on startup of app?:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Don't delete, in fact allow users to add events that happened in the past. 
   * Pros: Our target audience (Financial Advisors) might need to look up what past events or meetings have occured. Keeping past events serves as a good record.Increase in storage 
   * Cons: More storage used by app

* **Alternative 2 :** Delete all past events, users are not permitted to add events that happened in the past
   * Pros: Less storage used up by app
   * Cons: Difficult to implement without bugs.




_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

###\[Developed\] Assigning clients a policy

Users can assign existing policies to a client, whilst providing uptake details
such as the premium amount and start/end dates. This is facilitated by the `PolicyAssignCommand` class
and `PolicyAssignCommandParser` classes.

The `PolicyAssignCommandParser` parses the input from the user and identifies which policy has to be assigned to
which client. The appropriate AssignedPolicy object is created with details given in the input 
and is then assigned to the respective client in `PolicyAssignCommand`.

* `Person#addPolicy(assignedPolicy)` - Attempts to add an assigned policy to a set of assigned policies stored within
the person object. It also returns a boolean describing if the assigned policy already exists in the set.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how an `assign` command is executed.

The interactions between the components during the usage scenario is shown in the *Sequence Diagram* below.

<p align="center" >
  <img src="images/AssignPolicySequenceDiagram.png" width="700"/>
</p>

Step 1: The user enters `parse(assign 1 1 pr/200 sd/2020-10-12 ed/2022-10-12)` command to assign the first policy
to the first person. The policy has a yearly premium of $200 and lasts for 2 years, from 2020 to 2022.

Step 2: The `PolicyAssignCommandParser` parses the input and confirm that the indices are valid. 
A `PolicyAssignCommand` object with all parameters is constructed. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
Policy and Person indices that are not found in the `UniquePersonList` and `UniquePolicyList` respectively
would be regarded as invalid indices. 
</div>

Step 3: The `PolicyAssignCommand` is executed. The corresponding policy and person objects are retrieved and the 
if not already assigned, the policy is assigned to the person.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Whether to allow users to assign policies to persons using names:**

* **Alternative 1:** Allows assignment using policy/persons names.
  * Pros: More flexible and quicker assigning if user knows exactly who and which policy they want to assign.
  * Cons: More-bug prone, and would require the user to accurately provide the exact name of the policy/person. 
  Hard to get used to for new users, and complicated for established users with lots of clients and policies.

* **Alternative 2: (Current implementation)** Allow assignment using policy/person indices.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and avoids confusion for new users.
  * Cons: Would require the user to check out the list and find out the indices of their target person/policy.
  This is overcome by the functionality of the `find` command, which allows users to filter the lists for specific 
  persons/policies.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### `Find` feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FilteredList` from the JavaFx library, by using `FilteredList#setPredicate()` to update the list of clients being displayed based on the specified metrics.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes a `find` command to find any clients matching the given metrics. The `find` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which parses the arguments and calls `FindCommandParser#parse()` with the obtained results

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the arguments to the command is invalid, the execution will stop at this step.
</div>

Step 2. `FindCommandParser#parse()` goes through the arguments and check which prefixes are present and creates a `FindCommand` object with the corresponding predicates.

Step 3. `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand` using the combined predicates, which calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and updates the list of clients displayed

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindXYZCommandParser` and `FindXYZCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How `find` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilise predicates and test for each predicate against each contact in the address book by making use of the JavaFx filteredList library.
    * Pros: 
      * Easy extension for additional predicates, by adding predicate classes
      * Lesser user implementation
    * Cons: 
      * If there are too many predicates, there could be an excessive number of classes to manage
      * Lesser control over lower level details of predicate testing

* **Alternative 2:** Take in user conditions and test for each person in the address book
    * Pros: 
      * More control over lower level details.
      * More efficient algorithms can be used for searching which can improve the overall runtime
    * Cons: 
      * Testing required to ensure that the predicate testing algorithms are implemented correctly
      * Larger overhead in writing code

Alternative 1 was preferred over alternative 2 due to the following reasons:
  * We could make use of the existing JavaFx library and reduce the amount of additional code that is required.
  * In addition, there is also a greater guarantee on the correctness of the code as compared to if we were to implement our own algorithms
  * Lesser testing overhead, which meant that we can focus more testing on the features implementation and reduce more potential bugs

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** A similar execution path can be observed for other find related operations like findPolicy and findEvent.
